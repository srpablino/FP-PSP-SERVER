# About OAuth2

The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to
obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner
by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP
service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own
behalf.

# Configuration

The Oauth2 security is disabled by default in development enviroment, this
configuration is in the `application-dev.properties` file and you can enable
oauth by removing the property:

```shell
 security.ignored=/**
```
